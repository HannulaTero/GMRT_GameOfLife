**Game of Life in GameMaker using WebGPU.**

This is an adaption of following JavaScript tutorial:
  https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0

Note, that this has been tested in GM Beta with early open beta GMRT runtime.
GMRT provides support for WebGPU in GameMaker. 
  IDE v2024.800.0.597, Runtime v2024.800.0.620, GMRT 0.12.0

Example uses WebGPU to do rendering and the computation for simulation.
Both Fragment, Vertex are used for rendering, and Compute shaders are used for calculating simulation.

Here is video how it looks like:
